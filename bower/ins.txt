Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities. Bower manages all these things for you.
Bower can manage components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or even image files. Bower doesn’t concatenate or minify code or do anything else - it just installs the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies

INSTALLING BOWER INSTRUCTIONS

Global installation
$ npm install -g bower
Bower requires node, npm and git.


Install packages
$ bower install <package>
 E.g bower install jquery

A package can be a GitHub shorthand, a Git endpoint, a URL, and more. Read more about bower install:


# installs the project dependencies listed in bower.json
$ bower install
# registered package
$ bower install jquery
# GitHub shorthand
$ bower install desandro/masonry
# Git endpoint
$ bower install git://github.com/user/package.git
# URL
$ bower install http://example.com/script.js



Create a bower.json
bower init.

Save new dependencies
bower install PACKAGE --save

NOTE:
gitignore bower_component files when pushing code online

BOWER ON GIT
bower.json installs all dependacies asssociated with the project.When you push code online,do the following
Download project from github
run the command 
bower install 
This one command installs all the dependacies you need on to run the project on your machine


CHANGING BOWER_COMPONENTS
Create a file .bowerrc and save to the main folder.
Type the directory in which you want to install your dependacies in such as:


{
	"directory": "pluggins"
}


or 
{
	"directory": "assets/pluggins"
}


when you run bower install jquery or bower install boostrap,the dependacies are installed in the pluggins  and asset/pluggins folders respectively
